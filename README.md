## Introduction
The codes in this repository are contributed to the C++ programming course held by *Chair for Clinical Bioinformatics* (UdS) in winter semester, 2019. Only the problems relevant to my current Bioinformatics-oriented practices are reposited and distributed under 4 assignment projects.
