## Introduction
Here lie the programs I have written in the C++ programming course held by the *Chair for Clinical Bioinformatics* (University of Saarland) in winter semester of 2019. Only the codes that are helpful in certain contexts relevant to my Bioinformatics-oriented practices are reposited and are divided into 4 assignment projects. Follows is the list of topics which are found under each project.
